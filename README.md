# Push Swap

# Introduction
The Push Swap project is a straightforward algorithm project where the task is to sort a set of integer values using two stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks. The goal is to write a program in C called push_swap that calculates and displays the smallest program, made of Push Swap instructions, that sorts the integers received as arguments.

# Objectives
Writing a sorting algorithm is a crucial step in a developerâ€™s journey, often introducing the concept of complexity. Sorting algorithms and their complexity are classic topics discussed during job interviews, making it essential to understand them thoroughly. The learning objectives of this project include rigor, the use of C, basic algorithms, and especially focusing on their complexity.

# Rules
- The project involves two stacks named a and b.
- At the beginning:
  - Stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers without duplicates.
  - Stack b is empty.
- The goal is to sort numbers in ascending order into stack a using specific operations.

- Requirements:
  - The program must display the smallest list of instructions possible to sort the stack a, with each instruction separated by a newline character.
  - If no parameters are specified, the program must not display anything and return the prompt.
  - In case of error, it must display "Error" followed by a newline on the standard error.

# Bonus
The bonus part of the project involves creating a checker program to validate whether the list of instructions generated by the push_swap program actually sorts the stack properly.

- Requirements:
  - The program takes the stack a as an argument and reads instructions from the standard input, executing them on the stack.
  - If the stack a is sorted, and stack b is empty after executing the instructions, the program must display "OK" followed by a newline on the standard output.
  - Otherwise, it must display "KO" followed by a newline on the standard output.
  - In case of error, it must display "Error" followed by a newline on the standard error.
